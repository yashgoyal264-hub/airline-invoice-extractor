## Usage Tracking

The application logs the following data to Google Sheets:
- User Email
- Session ID
- Timestamp
- Number of Files Processed
- Processing Time
- Success Rate
- Error Count
- Tool Version

## Browser Requirements

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Security Considerations

- All PDF processing happens client-side
- No sensitive data is sent to external servers
- Only usage metadata is logged to Google Sheets
- Email validation is for access control only

## Troubleshooting

### Google Drive Links Not Working
- Ensure the PDF files are publicly accessible or shared with "Anyone with the link"
- Try using the direct download URL format: `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download`

### Google Sheets Logging Not Working
1. Verify the Google Apps Script is deployed correctly
2. Check that the Web App URL is updated in `config/constants.js`
3. Ensure "Anyone" access is enabled in deployment settings

### PDF Extraction Issues
- Ensure PDFs are text-based (not scanned images)
- For scanned PDFs, OCR processing would be needed (not currently implemented)
- Check that invoice format matches expected IndiGo format

### Authentication Issues
- Clear browser localStorage and try again
- Ensure email domain is exactly @fabhotels.com or @travelplusapp.com

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify all setup steps were completed
3. Contact the development team with specific error details
